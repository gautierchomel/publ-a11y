			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/">EPUB Accessibility Conformance and
					Discovery Specification defines a schema.org metadata term called "accessibilitySummary."</a> This
				piece of metadata is extraordinarily unique and important in that it provides a human readable
				description of the accessibility of the publication. It is expected that people who do not have formal
				training in HTML, EPUB, or who are not experts in accessibility will be reading the
				accessibilitySummary. Online Library and retail catalogues should present the accessibilitySummary to
				assist in making the decision to purchase or recommend the title. Individuals, professors, schools and
				universities should be basing their decisions to purchase on the accessibility of products.</p>

			<p>The metadata accessibilitySummary can be found in either of two places, inside the EPUB in the OPF file,
				or this information can be retrieved from ONIX <a href="https://ns.editeur.org/onix/en/196">code list:
					196</a>; Code: 00: Accessibility Summary.</p>

			<p class="note">Refer to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/09/UX-Guide-metadata-1.0/principles/">User
					Experience Guide for Displaying Accessibility Metadata 1.0</a> for libraries and retailers.</p>
			<p class="note">Please note that the accessibility summary is written from the perspective of the supplier
				creating these files and some features and functions will vary depending on the reading system or
				distributor the end user is operating within.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="before-writing">
			<h2>Before you start writing</h2>

			<p>The <a href="https://daisy.github.io/ace/">Accessibility Checker for EPUB (Ace by DAISY)</a> is a tool
				which can be used to help you determine some of the accessibility features within the publication. This
				information can be found when looking at the report.html file Ace creates. This will help you determine
				what should be included in the accessibilitySummary that will be put into the OPF file and/or ONIX
				metadata feed.</p>

			<p>Next read the accessibility metadata in the EPUB package.opf file before you begin to write. Make note of
				the features listed in the metadata as you prepare to write. One should always truthfully represent the
				accessibility of the publication and point out shortcomings of the publication; students may be able to
				get assistance from their school or university if some aspects of the publication are not accessible.
				For example, if complex graphics that convey information do not have an extended description, let people
				know that extended descriptions are not available.</p>

		<section id="high-level-considerations">
			<h2>Some High-Level Considerations</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>There should only be one accessibility summary. Do not include multiple accessibility summaries in
					different languages.</li>
				<li>The language of the accessibility summary should be in the primary language of the publication. For
					example, a publication in French should have the accessibility summary also in French. While some
					publications may have many passages in another language, the primary language should be determined.
					For example, a publication intended to teach Spanish to English speaking students would have the
					primary language as English.</li>
				<li>Ensure the language of the accessibility summary is declared in the metadata.</li>
				<li>It should be noted that markup in metadata is commonly not allowed. While it may be tempting to use headings, bullets, bold, or  other markup, this must not be used.</li>

				<li>Use simple language that communicates effectively to a non-technical and a non-accessibility aware
					community.</li>
				<li>Avoid terms that are only known in a specific knowledge domain, or explain the term in a simple
					way.</li>
					<li>The use of jargon or language that is not commonly understood should be avoided. It is better to explain what is meant. For example, the term "reflow" may not be understood by most people. Saying, "This publication is in EPUB 3 and supports the selection of font size which will enlarge the text and then wrap to fit the screen" is better than saying this publication supports reflowable text.</li>

					
				<li>Write out the words of the acronym before using the abbreviation, e.g. Web Content Accessibility
					Guidelines (WCAG).</li>
				<li>Include all accessibility features, even those detailed in another schema.org metadata item;
					remember that the AccessibilitySummary may be the only piece of metadata that some users read.</li>
				<li>The length of the Accessibility Summary is important. Ideally the accessibilitySummary should be
					under 1000 characters and we recommend against an accessibility summary over 2000 characters in
					length. The ONIX guideline suggests 500 characters, and we have asked that this guideline be
					increased. </li>
				<li>The Accessibility Summary should be compact and place the most essential information at the
					beginning. We have no way of knowing how many characters various systems will display, and it is
					possible that the Accessibility Summary be truncated after a system-dependent number of characters.
					Also, we believe people will be reading quickly and if the Accessibility Summary is long, people may
					read only the beginning section.</li>
				<li>Templates may be a useful approach for creating accessibility summaries in your organization,
					especially if all the content of a similar type goes through the same workflow and quality assurance
					process. However, make sure that the <code>accessibilitySummary</code> metadata that ships with the
					publication is accurate and applies to this particular publication.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>What to Include in the <code>AccessibilitySummary</code></h2>

			<p>Here is a list of areas that the summary should address :</p>

			<section id="accessibility-conformance">
				<h3>Accessibility Conformance Related Statements</h3>

				<p>The group of conformance statements are listed below. The level of conformance should be identified
					such as AA or A. There is also the possibility of referencing conformance to an "optomized"
					specification, which might not meet WCAG guidelines, such as an audio only specification. It is
					possible for the publisher to self-certify and not having third party certification should be noted.
					It has been brought up that WCAG A and AA conformance is a difficult or impossible claim to make,
					and will be addressed in WCAG 3.0. For this reason, some organizations plan to qualify their claim
					by saying, "as far as we know" or "it strives to" in their statement. The suggested summary below
					contains this language.</p>

				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Accessibility Metadata</th>
							<th>Priority</th>
							<th>Suggested summary</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>Conformance statement </td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>This publication strives to meet accepted Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) at
								the AA level.</td>

				<h3>Screen Reader Friendly</h3>
<p>In the past, it has been difficult to determine if persons who use a screen reader will have complete (sufficient) access to the content of a publication. If the content is available as text and the description of important (non-decorative) graphical content is sufficient to provide access, then we recommend using the term “Screen Reader Friendly.” This can be determined with both Schema.org and ONIX. WCAG level “A” has required a text equivalent representation starting with 2.0. Alt text, extended descriptions, and descriptions in the surrounding text are the most common techniques to provide this level of access. In Schema.org, the term accessModeSufficient captures this important characteristic. If textual alone is denoted, you can have confidence that the publication will be Screen reader friendly. We will use the Accessibility Metadata description “complete textual content.”</p>

				<p>Accessibility hazards: Some content, especially videos, may contain elements that have been found to
					be problematic. Most common items are motion effects that make some people motion sick, flashing
					that can cause severe distractions or even seizures, or loud sharp noises like a gunshot which can
					cause hearing issues. It is only necessary to include this information if it is present.</p>
