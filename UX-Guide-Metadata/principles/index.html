			<p>Finding, buying, and finally reading a book is a very personal experience. For most of us this is routine where we go to a bookstore search for the title we are interested in or perhaps browse the best sellers list, then purchase and start reading the book.</p>
			<p>Now consider you are blind and rely on assistive technology to read this book. Will my screen reader work with this title? Are there image descriptions that will be spoken to describe these images, are there page numbers which are accessible, is the reading order correct so I don't hear chapter 4 before chapter 3? These are just a few of the accessibility concerns consumers have when trying to purchase and ultimately read electronic publication.</p>
			<p>The good news is more and more publishers are creating Born Accessible publications and also getting the accessibility validation or audit done by independent organizations.</p>
			<p>This document proposes a shared framework for presenting publication accessibility metadata in a user-friendly manner.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd"></section>
		<section id="general-overview">
			<h2>General Overview</h2>
			<p>This document will help those who wish to provide accessibility metadata directly to users understand how
				to represent machine readable accessibility metadata in a user friendly User Interface / User Experience
				(UI/UX).</p>
			<div class="note">
				<p>This document presents high-level principles, without going into technical issues related to the different metadata standards in the publishing industry.</p>
				<p>Therefore, <a href="#techniques">techniques are available</a>, illustrating to developers how to retrieve data to show the information outlined in this document.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Metadata found either inside a digital publication or in the corresponding external record may have important accessibility information that will help end users find and determine if this publication can meet their specific accessibility needs.</p>
			<p>Most metadata is meant to be machine readable so that it can be used to aid in user search queries such
				as <q>Find all digital publications that contain large print, or braille, or that has met a certain level of
					accessibility conformance.</q> The exception to this is the accessibility summary which, if present,
				describes in human-readable text all the accessibility features and any shortcomings present in this
				book that can be directly presented to the end user.</p>

			<p>Here is an example of what a user-friendly accessibility metadata web page could look like:</p>
			<aside class="example">
				<p><strong>Screen Reader Friendly:</strong> Yes</p>
				<p><strong>Accessibility Summary:</strong> This publication includes markup to enable accessibility and
					compatibility with assistive technology. Images, audio, and video in the publication are
					well-described in conformance with WCAG 2.0 AA.</p>
				<p><strong>Accessibility Conformance:</strong>
					<a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility-20170105.html#wcag-aa">EPUB Accessibility, WCAG2.0-AA</a></p>
				<p><strong>Certified By:</strong> ACME Certification</p>
				<p><strong>Certifier Credential:</strong>
					<img src="./media/image1.png" alt="ACME Inc. credential webpage" width="50" /></p>
				<p><strong>All Accessibility Metadata:</strong></p>

		<section id="discovering-accessible-content">
			<h2>Discovering Accessible Content</h2>
			<p>The guidelines for presentation of accessibility metadata in this document are intended to improve the
				user experience when readers browse the catalog entry for a book. However, accessibility metadata also
				has a vital role to play in helping readers discover books that are accessible for them. Book providers,
				vendors, and libraries are encouraged to create searching and filtering tools that interpret
				accessibility metadata to aid in discovery; a full discussion of this topic is out of scope for this
				document, but these brief notes may be helpful until further research and development leads to more
				specific guidance.</p>
			<p>While every user has different accessibility needs, meeting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
				(WCAG) 2.0 requirements, even at level A, is a baseline that ensures a book will be widely accessible.
				Book providers may therefore wish to create specific search capabilities to permit users to find books
				that have declared conformance to WCAG at any level. A search filter called Accessible that retrieves all books with metadata that indicates conformance to WCAG Level A, AA and/or AAA.</p>
			<p>Books with full audio created for mainstream use provide important access for many users with disabilities even
				though they are not accessible to others. Book providers may already have search tools aimed at finding
				audiobooks, since they are popular and fairly common, but if not, this would be a good addition to the
				suite of tools for finding accessible books. Note that audiobooks may not pass WCAG requirements because
				they are targeted at a specific audience rather than broadly accessible and so would not be found using
				the <q>Accessible</q> search suggested above.</p>
			<p>Any of the metadata fields discussed in detail below could also be used as a filter; a <q>Screen-reader
					accessible</q> search would be valued by screen reader users, and a way to ensure no books with
				hazards are downloaded would be valued by those with light-sensitive epilepsy or other hazard-related
				conditions. But if a single additional search filter fits best in a siteâ€™s UI, a tool for finding
				accessible materials that declare conformance to WCAG 2.0 is the most likely choice.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="ui-technical-details">
			<h2>UI Technical Details</h2>
			<p>When you have accessibility metadata about a digital publication it is important to share this information with the
				user in a user friendly way. At a very high level when displaying information about a digital publication you may just
				want to acknowledge that there is <q>Accessibility Features</q> or <q>Accessibility Information</q>
				available and if the user would like to get at this information they can click a text or image link which
				will then provide the information that is discussed below.</p>
			<p>In this example, a link to the accessibility information is provided with a traditional textual link.</p>
			<aside class="example">
				<p>Title: Huckleberry Finn</p>
				<p>Author: Mark Twain</p>
				<p>Copyright: 1999</p>
				<p>ISBN: 9780486110035</p>
				<p>Publisher: Dover Publications</p>
				<p>Book Features: <u>Accessibility Information</u>
					<em>(textual link to accessibility information below)</em></p>
			</aside>
			<p>Alternatively this link to the accessibility information could be provided with a clickable image.</p>
			<aside id="ex-bookFeatures" class="example">
				<p>Book Features:</p>
				<p><img  src="./media/accessibility.svg" alt="Accessibility Information" width="75" /></p>
				<p><em>(clickable image to accessibility information below)</em></p>
				<p><em>Suggested Alt-text for image <q>Accessibility Information</q></em></p>

                <h3>Techniques</h3>
                <p>To assist developers in implementing these guidelines, in-depth notes are available to explain how to extract information from publishing industry metadata standards.</p>
                <p>At the time of this document the available techniques for metadata standards are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p><a href="../techniques/epub-metadata.html">EPUB Accessibility Metadata</a></p></li>
					<li><p><a href="../techniques/onix.html">ONIX Accessibility Metadata</a></p></li>

		<section id="order-of-key-information">
			<h2>Order of Key Information</h2>
            <p>
                Ordering this information in a meaningful and consistent way is key so the most important information appears first to help the user quickly determine if this publication will meet their specific needs.</p>
            <p>
                The two most important accessibility accommodations are if the publication is "Screen Reader Friendly" which implies all text in the book is accessible and any images if present are described. Secondly, if the publication has "Full Audio". 
            </p>
            <p>
                The next important piece is the Accessibility Summary which is metadata describing all the accessibility accommodations provided by this publication.
                Following this are the accessibility conformance information (what level of conformance was reached, who certified it, and any certification credentials).
            </p>
            <p>Â 
                Finally displaying any hazards if present and linking to all the accessibility metadata including all the specific accessibility features such as: image descriptions, mathml, table of contents, etc.

			<section id="screen-reader-friendly">
				<h3>Screen Reader Friendly</h3>
				<p><b>Value</b>: <i>Yes</i> / <i>No</i> / <i>Unknown</i></p>
				<h4>Definition</h4>
				<p>A Yes/No/Unknown answer to the question "Can a screen-reader user read this publication?". This can be based on a combination of metadata fields, if needed, that establish that the primary content of the publication is available in true text and is not an image of text.</p>
				<h4>Rationale</h4>
				<p>Most available digital publications include their content in true text and can report that they are screen reader friendly. Exceptions would include publications where critical content is included only in images, such as graphs, charts, or equations presented as images, and publications with a fixed appearance created by having an image of each page instead of true text.</p>
                <h4>Implementation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="../techniques/epub-metadata.html#screen-reader-friendly">EPUB Accessibility: Screen Reader Friendly</a></li>
                    <li><a href="../techniques/onix.html#screen-reader-friendly">ONIX: Screen Reader Friendly</a></li>
                </ul>
			</section>
			
			<section id="full-audio">
				<h3>Full Audio</h3>
				<p><b>Values</b>: <i>Yes / (if No - Omit this section)</i></p>
				<h4>Definition</h4>
				<p>An indication that this publication can be used by listening. This designation can be applied if text will also appear on a display as long as the text is not required to use the publication.</p>
				<h4>Rationale</h4>
				<p>Some users, including users with dyslexia or visual impairments, seek books they can use entirely by listening. Full Audio metadata is important to the discovery process for these users. Book providers, vendors, and libraries may already be designating "audiobooks" as a separately searchable set based on the popular definition of an audiobook as an audio-only experience. Publications that include full text and full audio may not currently be grouped with audiobooks, so exposing this metadata adds additional publications to the list of titles audio users might be interested in.</p>
                <p>Audiobooks presented without text are considered optimized publications. They do not meet all accessibility requirements, and therefore will not be discovered when filtering for "accessible" books, but they provide access to the publication for specific users who require audio. Providing a way for users to search a collection for all books with full audio will support these users, and including this information in the metadata displayed will also alert users for whom audio is inaccessible. This piece of metadata should be included only if the value is "Yes". Since most digital publications available do not include audio, it is only important to include this metadata in the user interface for those that do.</p>
                <h4>Implementation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="../techniques/epub-metadata.html#full-audio">EPUB Accessibility: Full Audio</a></li>
                    <li><a href="../techniques/onix.html#full-audio">ONIX: Full Audio</a></li>
                </ul>

			</section>
			
			<section id="accessibility-summary">
				<h3>Accessibility Summary</h3>
				<p><b>Value</b>: Textual Data from metadata</p>
				<h4>Definition</h4>
				<p>A plain language explanation of the overall accessibility of the publication. The accessibility summary should contain information that would make it easy for an end user to determine if the publication is accessible to them. Educators would also be able to determine if the publication was accessible for use in a classroom or an online course.</p>
				<h4>Rationale</h4>
				<p>A human readable description is needed to be available for an end user or an educational professional to determine if the title will be accessible to them personally, or to the students. It should be easy to read and understand if it will be suitable for use by persons with disabilities. This determination must be made before the end user purchases or selects the title, and must be determined before a title is selected for a course.</p>
                <h4>Implementation</h4>
                <ul>
                     <li><a href="../techniques/epub-metadata.html#accessibility-summary">EPUB Accessibility: Summary</a></li>

			<section id="accessibility-conformance">
				<h3>Accessibility Conformance</h3>
				<p><b>Value</b>: Textual Link based on Metadata</p>
				<h4>Definition</h4>
				<p>To report the accessibility conformance of a publication, metadata for accessibility conformance should be provided. It declares the accessibility standard or accessibility specifications to which the publication conforms. The value can be a URL or a code which identifies the accessibility standard or accessibility specifications.</p>
				<p class="note">In case of EPUB publications, it will usually point to the EPUB Accessibility specifications or WCAG.</p>
				<p class="note">If a publication is optimized for a particular user group, e.g. an audiobook, it would not conform to WCAG guidelines, but it may be perfectly useable by a particular group, e.g. persons who are blind. In this case, the accessibility conformance metadata should identify the specification used to create the optimized publication.</p>
				<h4>Rationale</h4>
				<p>Discovery metadata enables publications to have their accessibility exposed regardless of the overall accessibility of the publication. A publication optimized for a particular group, such as an audiobook, would not meet WCAG 2.0, but it would be fully accessible to many people. The conformance metadata details the accessibility of the publication, which allows end users and educators to evaluate the suitability of the publication for individuals.</p>

			<section id="certified-by">
				<h3>Certified By</h3>
				<p><b>Value</b>: Textual Data from metadata</p>
				<h4>Definition</h4>
				<p>The <i>Certified By</i> property specifies the name of the party that certified the content. The certifier of the content could be the same party that created or published the publication, but can also be a third-party accessibility certifier.</p>
				<h4>Rationale</h4>
				<p>When the metadata about a publication declares that it conforms to an accessibility specification reaching a certain level of WCAG conformance, the party making this assertion must be identified.</p>
                <h4>Implementation</h4>

				<h3>Certifier Credential</h3>
				<p><b>Value</b>: Potentially linked textual data from metadata</p>
				<h4>Definition</h4>
				<p>The <i>Certifier Credential</i> indicates the name of the credential or badge that establishes the authority of the certifying party.</p>
				<h4>Rationale</h4>
				<p>Stating that the organization certifying this content has a credential recognized by the community gives a higher level of trust as to the accuracy of the conformance level reached.</p>
                <h4>Implementation</h4>

			<section id="certifier-report">
				<h3>Certifier Report</h3>
				<p><b>Value</b>: Potentially linked textual data from metadata</p>
				<h4>Definition</h4>
				<p>The <i>Certifier Report</i> is an URL pointing to a web page where the certifier publishes a report detailing the accessibility of the publication.</p>
				<h4>Rationale</h4>
				<p>Providing a link to the complete report allows end users and organizations to review it. The user interface should display a link to the report.</p>

			<section id="hazards">
				<h3>Hazards</h3>
				<p><b>Values</b>: flashing, motion simulation, sound, no flashing, no motion simulation, no
					sound, none, or unknown.</p>
				<h4>Definition</h4>
				<p>Hazards are a list of possible ways in which this publication could be physiologically dangerous for some users (e.g. flashing elements, background sounds, motion simulation, etc.).</p>
				<h4>Rationale</h4>
				<p>Unlike other accessibility properties, the presence of hazards can be expressed either positively or negatively. This is because users are more often looking for content that is safe for them. This section should always be displayed; indicate that no metadata was provided if that is the case.</p>
                <h4>Implementation</h4>

			<section id="all-accessibility-metadata">
				<h3>All Accessibility Metadata</h3>
				<p><b>Value</b>: Link to complete list of all metadata fields</p>
				<h4>Definition</h4>
				<p>It is a pointer to show the listing of all the accessibility metadata of the publication. It can be a hyperlink to another page or can be listed in HTML summary/details element. It should include metadata for <i>accessibilityFeature</i>, <i>accessibilityHazard</i>, <i>accessMode</i>, <i>accessModeSufficient</i> and all the accessibility metadata and conformance metadata listed above.</p>
				<h4>Rationale</h4>
				<p>A complete list of accessibility metadata is important for advanced users who would like to know about the presence of specific accessibility features in the publication. This listing is also important for verification of the interpretation of the accessibility metadata provided according to this user experience guide.</p>
