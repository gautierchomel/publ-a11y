			<h2>General Overview</h2>
			<p>This document will help those who wish to provide accessibility metadata directly to users understand how
				to represent machine readable accessibility metadata in a user friendly User Interface / User Experience
				(UI/UX).</p>
			<p>Metadata found either inside an EPUB or in its corresponding ONIX file may have important accessibility
				information that will help end users find and determine if this EPUB can meet their specific
				accessibility needs.</p>
			<p>Most metadata is meant to be machine readable so that it can be used to aid in user search queries such
				as <q>Find all EPUB books that contain large print, or braille, or that has met a certain level of
					accessibility conformance.</q> The exception to this is the accessibility summary which, if present,
				describes in human-readable text all the accessibility features and any shortcomings present in this
				book that can be directly presented to the end user.</p>
			<p class="note">All images provided here may be protected under copyright and are only used as a
				reference.</p>
			<p>Here is an example of what a user-friendly accessibility metadata web page could look like:</p>
			<aside class="example">
				<p><strong>Screen Reader Friendly:</strong> Yes</p>
				<p><strong>Accessibility Summary:</strong> This publication includes markup to enable accessibility and
					compatibility with assistive technology. Images, audio, and video in the publication are
					well-described in conformance with WCAG 2.0 AA.</p>
				<p><strong>EPUB Accessibility Conformance:</strong>
					<a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility-20170105.html#wcag-aa">WCAG-AA</a></p>
				<p><strong>Certified By:</strong> ACME Certification</p>
				<p><strong>Certifier Credential:</strong>

			<h2>Discovering Accessible Content</h2>
			<p>The guidelines for presentation of accessibility metadata in this document are intended to improve the
				user experience when readers browse the catalog entry for a book. However, accessibility metadata also
				has a vital role to play in helping readers discover books that are accessible for them. Book providers,
				vendors, and libraries are encouraged to create searching and filtering tools that interpret
				accessibility metadata to aid in discovery; a full discussion of this topic is out of scope for this
				document, but these brief notes may be helpful until further research and development leads to more
				specific guidance.</p>
			<p>While every user has different accessibility needs, meeting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
				(WCAG) 2.0 requirements, even at level A, is a baseline that ensures a book will be widely accessible.
				Book providers may therefore wish to create specific search capabilities to permit users to find books
				that have declared conformance to WCAG at any level. A search filter called <q>Accessible</q> that
				retrieves all books with metadata of <code>&lt;link rel="dcterms:conformsTo"
					href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility-20170105.html#wcag-a" /&gt;</code> or the
				equivalent for wcag-aa and ultimately for wcag-aaa would fill this need.</p>
			<p>Audiobooks created for mainstream use provide important access for many users with disabilities even
				though they are not accessible to others. Book providers may already have search tools aimed at finding
				audiobooks, since they are popular and fairly common, but if not, this would be a good addition to the
				suite of tools for finding accessible books. Note that audiobooks may not pass WCAG requirements because
				they are targeted at a specific audience rather than broadly accessible and so would not be found using
				the <q>Accessible</q> search suggested above.</p>
			<p>Any of the metadata fields discussed in detail below could also be used as a filter; a <q>Screen-reader
					accessible</q> search would be valued by screen reader users, and a way to ensure no books with
				hazards are downloaded would be valued by those with light-sensitive epilepsy or other hazard-related
				conditions. But if a single additional search filter fits best in a siteâ€™s UI, a tool for finding
				accessible materials that declare conformance to WCAG 2.0 is the most likely choice.</p>

			<h2>UI Technical Details</h2>
			<p>When you have accessibility metadata about an EPUB it is important to share this information with the
				user in a user friendly way. At a very high level when displaying information about an EPUB you may just
				want to acknowledge that there is <q>Accessibility Features</q> or <q>Accessibility Information</q>
				available and if the user would like to get at this information they can click a link or an image which
				will then provide the information that is discussed below.</p>
			<p>For Example:</p>
			<aside class="example">
				<p>Title: Huckleberry Finn</p>
				<p>Author: Mark Twain</p>
				<p>Copyright: 1999</p>
				<p>ISBN: 9780486110035</p>
				<p>Publisher: Dover Publications</p>
				<p>Book Features: <u>Accessibility Information</u>
					<em>(textual link to accessibility information below)</em></p>

				<p>Book Features:</p>

				<p><em>(clickable image to accessibility information below)</em></p>
