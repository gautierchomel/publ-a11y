			<p>Finding, buying, and finally reading a publication is a very personal experience. For most of us this is routine. We go to a bookstore, search for the title we are interested in or perhaps browse the best sellers list, then purchase and start reading the publication.</p>
			<p>Now consider you are blind and rely on an assistive technology to read the publication. You wonder: will my screen reader work with this title; are there image descriptions that will be spoken to describe these images; are there page numbers which are accessible; is the reading order correct so I don't hear a <q>caution</q> after reading a paragraph which could be dangerous? These are just a few of the accessibility concerns consumers have when trying to purchase and ultimately read a digital publication.</p>
			<p>The good news is more and more publishers are creating publications that are Born Accessible (i.e., accessible from the outset, not fixed later) and getting the accessibility validation or audit done by independent organizations.</p>
			<p>This document proposes a shared framework for presenting publication accessibility metadata in a user-friendly manner.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd"></section>
		<section id="general-overview">
			<h2>General Overview</h2>
			<p>This document helps those who wish to render accessibility metadata directly to users understand how
				to represent machine-readable accessibility metadata in a user-friendly User Interface / User Experience
				(UI/UX).</p>
			<div class="note">
				<p>This document presents high-level principles without going into technical issues related to the different metadata standards in the publishing industry.</p>
				<p>Therefore, <a href="#techniques">techniques are available</a> that illustrate to developers how to retrieve data to show the information outlined in this document.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Metadata found either inside a digital publication or in a corresponding external record may have important accessibility information that helps end users find and determine if the publication can meet their specific accessibility needs.</p>
			<p>Most metadata is meant to be machine-readable so that it aids in user search queries such
				as <q>Find all digital publications that contain large print, or braille, or that meet a certain level of
					accessibility conformance.</q></p>
			
			<p>The exception to this rule is the accessibility summary which, if present,
				describes in human-readable prose the accessibility features present in the
				publication as well as any shortcomings, when applicable. This summary is intended for direct presentation to end users.</p>

			<p>Here is an example of what a user-friendly accessibility metadata web page could look like:</p>
			<aside class="example">
				<p><b>Screen Reader Friendly:</b> Yes</p>
				<p><b>Accessibility Summary:</b> This publication includes markup to enable accessibility and
					compatibility with assistive technology. Images, audio, and video in the publication are
					well-described in conformance with WCAG 2.0 AA.</p>
				<p><b>Accessibility Conformance:</b>
					<a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility-20170105.html#wcag-aa">EPUB Accessibility, WCAG2.0-AA</a></p>

			<h2>Discovering Accessible Content</h2>
			<p>The guidelines for presenting accessibility metadata detailed in this document are intended to improve the
				user experience when readers browse the catalog entry for a publication. However, accessibility metadata also
				has a vital role to play in helping readers discover publications that are accessible for them. Publication providers, such as
				vendors and libraries, are encouraged to create searching and filtering tools that interpret
				accessibility metadata to aid in discovery. (A full discussion of search and filtering issues is out of
				scope for this document, but this section provides some guidance until further research can be carried out.)</p>
			<p>While every user has different accessibility needs, meeting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
				(WCAG) 2.0 requirements, even at level A, is a baseline that ensures a publication will be widely accessible.
				Publication providers may therefore wish to create specific search capabilities to permit users to find publications
				that have declared conformance to WCAG at any level. We suggest the creation of an "Accessible" search filter that only returns publications with metadata that indicates conformance to the user-selected WCAG Level &#8212; A, AA, or AAA.</p>
			<p>Publications with full audio created for mainstream use provide important access for many users with disabilities even
				though they are not accessible to all. (Note that these publications differ from traditional audiobooks in that the audio
				accompanies the full or partial text of the publication.) Publication providers may already have search tools aimed at finding
				traditional audiobooks, since they are popular and common, but even if not, this would be a good addition to the
				suite of tools for finding accessible publications. Publications with full audio may not pass WCAG requirements, however, because
				they are targeted at a specific audience rather than broadly accessible. As a result, they would not be found using
				the <q>Accessible</q> search suggested above.</p>
			<p>Any of the metadata fields discussed in detail below could also be used as a filter &#8212; a <q>Screen-reader
					accessible</q> search would be valued by screen reader users, and a way to ensure no publications with
				hazards are downloaded would be valued by those with light-sensitive epilepsy or other hazard-related
				conditions. But if only a single additional search filter fits best in a site's UI, a tool for finding
				accessible materials that declare conformance to WCAG 2.0 is the best choice to provide.</p>

		<section id="ui-technical-details">
			<h2>UI Technical Details</h2>
			<p>When you have accessibility metadata about a digital publication, it is important to share this information in as user-friendly a way as possible. At a very high level, when displaying information about a digital publication, you may only want to acknowledge that <q>Accessibility Features</q> or <q>Accessibility Information</q> is available. If the user would like to get at this information, they can click a text or image link which will then provide the information that is discussed below.</p>
			<div class="note">
				<p>When a publisher does not provide any accessibility metadata for a publication, a statement should be displayed to the user informing them that no information was supplied.</p>

			<section id="enable-reading-without-sight">
				<h3>Supports non visual reading</h3>
				<p>A Yes/No/Unknown answer to the question "Can a user reading without sight get a restitution of all contents?".</p>
				<p>Indicates that all content required for comprehension can be consulted in text and therefore is fully rendered to assistive technologies and text-to-speech functions proposed by the Reading System.</p>
				<p>Most digital publications available include their content in digital text. Exceptions are publications where some of the content essential to understanding is included in images, such as graphs, tables or equations presented as images, and publications where the fixed appearance is created by an image on each page instead of actual text. In those cases a textual alternative must be provided to insure that users reading with other senses than sight (mainly auditive and tactile) get a complete restitution of the content necesary for comprehension.</p>

				<h3>Navigation</h3>
				
				<p>Offering different ways to navigate the ebook content is important to allow the user to access each part of the content. These features, which are essential for accessibility, are very important for all users reading digital content. Therefore, clearly communicating to the user what navigation features are available in the ebook is important to enable proper book selection.</p>
				
				<p>Moreover Web Content Accessibility Guidelines standard state that <q>More than one way is available to locate a Web page within a set of Web pages</q> (<cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#multiple-ways">WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.5 Multiple Ways</a></cite>). Relating to ebooks, the web pages are the content of the book and the set of web pages is the ebook itself. Therefore, it is important to communicate to the user the different mechanisms that are present in the ebook to navigate the content: Table of Contents, Index, etc.</p>
				<h4>Examples</h4>
				<p>The exemples are provided as extended (separated sentences) and compact (one sentence) for flexibility.</p>
				<ul>
				<li>
				<p>Separated sentences:</p>
				<aside class="example">Contains a table of contents that provides direct access to all chapters of the text via links.</aside>
				<aside class="example">Index provides links to item references.</aside>
				<aside class="example">Landmarks provides quick access to main parts of the book.</aside>
				<aside class="example">There are references to link pages in the paginated version, with pages in the fluid layout version.</aside>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>One sentence:</p>

				<h3>Charts, Diagrams and Formulas</h3>
				
				<p>This group of metadata is used to indicate to end users the presence of formulas and complex graphs, charts and diagrams within the title and whether or not these are usable in accessible format: for example, whether formulas are navigable with assistive technologies, or whether extendend descriptions are available for complex images.</p>
				
				<p>This group should be displayed only if the metadata indicates the presence of formulas or charts and graphs within the title, otherwise it can be hidden.</p>
				
				<h4>Examples</h4>
				<p>This example to indicate the presence of accessible formulas and graphs:</p>
				<aside class="example">Contains accessible formulas. Charts and diagrams are present and described by extended descriptions.</aside>
				<p>Short version:</p>
				<aside class="example">Accessible formulas, charts and diagrams with extended descriptions.</aside>

			<section id="book-features">
				<h3>Book Features</h3>
				
				<p>This group of metadata provides a comprehensive description of the various functionalities and capabilities offered by an ebook. Groups together all the features that are not expressed by the other metadata groups.</p>

				<p>Book features metadata includes a wide range of information related to ebook's content, therefore we group the features into subgroups so that the presentation is more understandable to end users.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b>Structure</b>: identify structuring aids that facilitate use of a resource (e.g. annotations, ARIA)</li>
					<li><b>Adaptation</b>: identify provisions in the content that enable reading in alternative access modes (e.g. closed captions, ruby annotations, sign language, transcript)</li>
					<li><b>Clarity</b>: identify ways that the content has been enhanced for improved auditory or visual clarity (e.g. high contrast display)</li>
					<li><b>Tactile</b>: identify content that is available in tactile form (e.g. tactile content, tactile graphic, tactile objects)</li>
					<li><b>Content</b>: explain specific types of contents present in the ebook (e.g. text on visual, music on visual)</li>
					<li><b>Other</b>: e.g. timing control and color dependent</li>
				</ul>

				<p>This serves as a valuable resource for readers enabling them to understand the unique attributes and functionalities of the ebook, empowering readers to make informed decisions based on their preferences and needs. Additionally, this metadata serves as a valuable reference for digital libraries, online marketplaces, and ebook distribution platforms, ensuring accurate categorization and efficient discovery of ebooks with specific functionalities.</p>

				<h3>Conformance</h3>
				
<p>The conformance group provides the assertions made concerning the accessibility of the publication. The language should be simple and report if accessibility recommendations are being met or if the publication is below suggested recommendations. At a minimum, the specification which it conforms to and the party doing the certification must be provided. It is also possible to determine if the certification is done by a third party. If the  publisher and the certifier property are different, then  this indicates the certification was done by a third party. The credentials of the certifying party and the  date of the evaluation will be of interest and should be provided. If there is a link to a report of the evaluation, that can also be provided. </p>
 
<dl>
<dt>Conformance Statement</dt><dd> Identifies the accessibility specification and the conformance level to which  the publication assertions are made. When the publication conforms to more than one specification, additional conformance statements may be provided. </dd>

<dt>Certifier's name</dt>  <dd>This provides information about the organization providing the certification review or process for certification. Having third party certification  is of high interest and should be provided. Third party certification can be determined by comparing the  name of the publisher and name of the certifier. If the values are different, then third party certifications are true. This can be provided as a parenthetical expression, i.e., inside parentheses.</dd> 
<dt>Certifier's Credentials </dt><dd>If the certifier has a badge or a credential, then the text is provided. If there is a link to their credential, then this can be provided as a link.</dd>
<dt>Certification date</dt><dd>If the date of the certifiers   evaluation is provided, then this would be of interest. This is normally associated with the certifier.</dd>
<dt>Certifier's Report</dt><dd>If a link to a report is provided, this may be of interest.</dd>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<p>The examples are provided first as a list of individual statements followed by a paragraph that concatinates statements that cover the whole conformance group. Either the list of individual statements or the paragraph style are appropriate, but do not provide both approaches. The conformance statement should be shown independently from the certifier and their associated information. Two examples are provided for the conformance statement, one shows a statement that meets recommended accessibility requirements and a second that shows a publication that is blow the recommended level.</p>
