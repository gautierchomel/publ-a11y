			<p>Finding, buying, and finally reading a publication is a very personal experience. For most of us this is routine. We go to a bookstore, search for the title we are interested in or perhaps browse the best sellers list, then purchase and start reading the publication.</p>
			<p>Now consider you are blind and rely on an assistive technology to read the publication. You wonder: will my screen reader work with this title; are there image descriptions that will be spoken to describe these images; are there page numbers which are accessible; is the reading order correct so I don't hear a <q>caution</q> after reading a paragraph which could be dangerous? These are just a few of the accessibility concerns consumers have when trying to purchase and ultimately read a digital publication.</p>
			<p>The good news is more and more publishers are creating publications that are Born Accessible (i.e., accessible from the outset, not fixed later) and getting the accessibility validation or audit done by independent organizations.</p>
			<p>This document proposes a shared framework for presenting publication accessibility metadata in a user-friendly manner.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd"></section>
		<section id="general-overview">
			<h2>General Overview</h2>
			<p>This document helps those who wish to render accessibility metadata directly to users understand how
				to represent machine-readable accessibility metadata in a user-friendly User Interface / User Experience
				(UI/UX).</p>
			<div class="note">
				<p>This document presents high-level principles without going into technical issues related to the different metadata standards in the publishing industry.</p>
				<p>Therefore, <a href="#techniques">techniques are available</a> that illustrate to developers how to retrieve data to show the information outlined in this document.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Metadata found either inside a digital publication or in a corresponding external record may have important accessibility information that helps end users find and determine if the publication can meet their specific accessibility needs.</p>
			<p>Most metadata is meant to be machine-readable so that it aids in user search queries such
				as <q>Find all digital publications that contain large print, or braille, or that meet a certain level of
					accessibility conformance.</q></p>
			
			<p>The exception to this rule is the accessibility summary which, if present,
				describes in human-readable prose the accessibility features present in the
				publication as well as any shortcomings, when applicable. This summary is intended for direct presentation to end users.</p>

			<p>Here is an example of what a user-friendly accessibility metadata web page could look like:</p>
			<aside class="example">
				<p><b>Screen Reader Friendly:</b> Yes</p>
				<p><b>Accessibility Summary:</b> This publication includes markup to enable accessibility and
					compatibility with assistive technology. Images, audio, and video in the publication are
					well-described in conformance with WCAG 2.0 AA.</p>
				<p><b>Accessibility Conformance:</b>
					<a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility-20170105.html#wcag-aa">EPUB Accessibility, WCAG2.0-AA</a></p>
				<p><b>Certified By:</b> ACME Certification</p>

			<h2>Discovering Accessible Content</h2>
			<p>The guidelines for presenting accessibility metadata detailed in this document are intended to improve the
				user experience when readers browse the catalog entry for a publication. However, accessibility metadata also
				has a vital role to play in helping readers discover publications that are accessible for them. Publication providers, such as
				vendors and libraries, are encouraged to create searching and filtering tools that interpret
				accessibility metadata to aid in discovery. (A full discussion of search and filtering issues is out of
				scope for this document, but this section provides some guidance until further research can be carried out.)</p>
			<p>While every user has different accessibility needs, meeting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
				(WCAG) 2.0 requirements, even at level A, is a baseline that ensures a publication will be widely accessible.
				Publication providers may therefore wish to create specific search capabilities to permit users to find publications
				that have declared conformance to WCAG at any level. We suggest the creation of an "Accessible" search filter that only returns publications with metadata that indicates conformance to the user-selected WCAG Level &#8212; A, AA, or AAA.</p>
			<p>Publications with full audio created for mainstream use provide important access for many users with disabilities even
				though they are not accessible to all. (Note that these publications differ from traditional audiobooks in that the audio
				accompanies the full or partial text of the publication.) Publication providers may already have search tools aimed at finding
				traditional audiobooks, since they are popular and common, but even if not, this would be a good addition to the
				suite of tools for finding accessible publications. Publications with full audio may not pass WCAG requirements, however, because
				they are targeted at a specific audience rather than broadly accessible. As a result, they would not be found using
				the <q>Accessible</q> search suggested above.</p>
			<p>Any of the metadata fields discussed in detail below could also be used as a filter &#8212; a <q>Screen-reader
					accessible</q> search would be valued by screen reader users, and a way to ensure no publications with
				hazards are downloaded would be valued by those with light-sensitive epilepsy or other hazard-related
				conditions. But if only a single additional search filter fits best in a site's UI, a tool for finding
				accessible materials that declare conformance to WCAG 2.0 is the best choice to provide.</p>

		<section id="ui-technical-details">
			<h2>UI Technical Details</h2>
			<p>When you have accessibility metadata about a digital publication, it is important to share this information in as user-friendly a way as possible. At a very high level, when displaying information about a digital publication, you may only want to acknowledge that <q>Accessibility Features</q> or <q>Accessibility Information</q> is available. If the user would like to get at this information, they can click a text or image link which will then provide the information that is discussed below.</p>
			<div class="note">
				<p>When a publisher does not provide any accessibility metadata for a publication, a statement should be displayed to the user informing them that no information was supplied.</p>

				<h3>Enable Reading Without Sight</h3>
				<h4>Definition</h4>
				<p>A Yes/No/Unknown answer to the question "Can a screen-reader user read this publication?". This can be based on a combination of metadata fields, if needed, that establish that the primary content of the publication is available in true text and is not an image of text.</p>
				<h4>Rationale</h4>
				<p>Most available digital publications include their content in true text and can report that they are screen reader friendly. Exceptions would include publications where critical content is included only in images, such as graphs, charts, or equations presented as images, and publications with a fixed appearance created by having an image of each page instead of true text.</p>
